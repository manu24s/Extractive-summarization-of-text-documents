# Extractive-summarization-of-text-documents
Automatic Text Summarization, one of the applications of Natural Language Processing, provides a 
concise, fluent summary of a long passage or document, retaining the salient information. With the ever
growing number of learning resources, it is becoming difficult for students to choose the best learning 
resource. Also, many students find it difficult to understand and retain highly factual content.In todayâ€™s Information Age, there is a state of exponential growth of data. Due to the flooding of data, the 
ability to wrangle, store, manipulate, analyze, interpret, utilize, and work upon the data is a principal 
concern. In the educational domain, with thick textbooks and large digital data, it is a great difficulty for 
people to refer and succeed in finding the matter they intended to, due to the large volume and veracity of 
data. This research deals with extractive summarization and tabulation of scholastic data which will help 
students, research scholars, teachers/lecturers and other interested audiences to get a synopsis of the 
chapters and units of textbooks of various subjects.
